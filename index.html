    <!-- ===== ABOUT ME ===== -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
           I am a fourth-year Systems Engineering student with over seven years of professional experience in high-responsibility environments related to migration security, border control, and air, land, and maritime operations. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong understanding of the operational, administrative, and technological processes that support national security and institutional management.
        </p>

        
        <p>
           During my time at the National Migration Service of Panama, I held key roles in maritime migration control, international document analysis, and eligibility verification for specialized visas for crew members, technicians, and superintendents in transit to Panama. This work was carried out under international protocols and standards aligned with organizations such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), strengthening my analytical skills, operational judgment, and attention to detail.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            I actively participated in the implementation of the Electronic E Visa for seafarers, a digital transformation project aimed at optimizing processes, reducing response times, strengthening traceability, and modernizing migration controls at international airports. My role focused on document analysis, workflow optimization, and inter-agency coordination with maritime authorities.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            I am currently complementing my background in security with technical training in software development, databases, and cybersecurity, positioning my profile toward the design of technological solutions that deliver efficiency, automation, and strategic value in complex environments.
        </p>
