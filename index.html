    <!-- ===== ABOUT ME ===== -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a fourth-year Systems Engineering student with seven years of professional experience in migration security
            and border control, working across air, land, and maritime operations. During my career at the National Migration
            Service of Panama, I developed a strong understanding of the operational, administrative, and technological
            processes that support national security.
        </p>

        <p>
            I held strategic and high-responsibility roles, including maritime migration control, international document
            analysis, eligibility verification, and approval of specialized visas for crew members, technicians, and
            superintendents transiting through Panama. This experience provided me with a solid understanding of
            international protocols, maritime regulations, and compliance with standards recommended by organizations such
            as the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
        </p>

        <p>
            I worked with technological tools used for international verification processes, including:
        </p>

        <ul class="tool-list">
            <li>BITMAP</li>
            <li>INTERPOL I-24/7</li>
            <li>TECS / APIS (CBP – Customs and Border Protection)</li>
            <li>SITA / Timatic</li>
            <li>Regional alert lists and advanced verification systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I participated in the development and implementation of the Electronic E Visa for seafarers, a project that
            digitalized processes, improved response times, strengthened controls at international airports, and reduced
            paper usage through a secure and traceable system. My role focused on document analysis, migration workflow
            optimization, and coordination with maritime agencies.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently strengthening my technical background in software development, databases, and cybersecurity,
            integrating my experience in security with technology-driven solutions that deliver efficiency and strategic
            value.
