        <h2>Electronic E Visa for Seafarers</h2>

        <p>
            I participated in the development and implementation of the Electronic E Visa process for seafarers,
            technicians, and superintendents entering Panama to embark, disembark, or carry out crew changes within
            national maritime operations. This project emerged as a response to the global need to streamline,
            digitalize, and secure specialized migration procedures, in compliance with guidelines established by
            the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
        </p>

        <p>
            My involvement focused on optimizing migration workflows and transitioning from manual procedures to a
            fully digital system. This included reviewing, validating, and transforming internal processes to ensure
            the platform met required security, traceability, and efficiency standards for maritime migration control.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Electronic E Visa significantly reduced paper usage, improved the accuracy of recorded information,
            and strengthened document traceability at every stage of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
            The technological component of the project enabled automated verifications at international airports
            prior to boarding, connecting with global security watchlists and advanced verification systems. This
            ensured a faster, safer, and more reliable process for both maritime agencies and crew members arriving
            from different parts of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            This experience strengthened my skills in analysis, inter-agency coordination, technical documentation,
            and technological adaptation, consolidating my profile as a professional capable of contributing to
            complex digital transformation projects.
